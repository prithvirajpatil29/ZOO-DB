        <h1>MY INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p>I was started with an area of 10.9 acres and in 1907 an additional 6.22 acres was included in me; and
            subsequently I was expanded to 45 acres. Mr. Huge, an Australian national was selected to head the expanded
            me as the superintendent. Later, another 50 acres of Kensington Gardens along with the Thandisadak was
            acquired and thus my total area has increased to 157.02 acre including 77.02 acres of Karanji Lake as on
            today.</p>
        <p>My special feature is my meticulous planning; I’m resorted in recreating the natural habitat for the
            different species of animals. A master plan was prepared on modern lines by removing the barred and fenced
            enclosures and providing moated enclosures for all the animals. At first, large-ape enclosures were built in
            the country in 1877 with big trees, bushes and lush grass for these animals to roam around and enjoy. A pair
            of Gorillas, Orangutans and some Chimpanzees acquired from other zoos and for the first time in Indian
            history, all these species of large apes could be seen together.</p>
        <p>Even today I have my own very special exhibits. At present I’m housing more than 1450 specimen comprising 150
            species representing more than 25 countries. These fascinating Animals include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Big Cats: Tiger, Leopard, Lions, Jaguar, Cheetahs</li>
            <li>Smaller Cats: Jungle Cat, Leopard Cat, Small Indian Civet, Common Palm Civet</li>
            <li>Primates: Chimpanzee, Gorilla, Orangutans, Capuchin Monkey, Marmoset, Lion Tailed Macaque, Hoolock
                Gibbon, Baboon, Brown Lemur, Ring Tailed Lemur, Nilgiri Langur, Common Langur.</li>
            <li>Deer and Antelopes: Spotted Deer, Hog Deer, Swamp Deer, Mouse Deer, Nilgai, Four Horned Antelope,
                Barking Deer, Black Buck, Fallow Deer, Goral.</li>
            <li>Large Mammals: Asiatic Elephants, African Elephants, Indian Rhino, Southern White Rhino, Hippopotamus,
                Gaur</li>
            <li>Aquatic Birds: Eurasian spoonbill, Pelicans, Flamingo, Adjutant Stork, Painted Stork Sacred Ibis</li>
            <li>Terrestrial Birds: Macaws, Conures, Pheasants, Sarus Crane, Great Indian Hornbill, Peafowl, Tragopan,
                Parrots and Parakeets.</li>
            <li>Ducks: Muscovy Duck, Spotted Whistling Duck, Comb Duck, Carolina Wood Duck</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I have always focused on the animal housing enrichments, animal comforts, hygiene and sanitation and
            developing better care facilities, and also to simulate and suit their behavioral needs. Significant
            programmes such as breeding of endangered fauna apart from exotic and endangered species are successfully
            carried out. They are my family members and I always stand by my responsibilities.</p>
        <p>I am also pioneering in captive breeding program and this has resulted in breeding more than 100 species in
            captivity. Providing spacious enclosure with a natural setting for welfare of the animals and also better
            education to the visitors became priority for me. My most promising feature is my role as an orphanage for
            rearing the abandoned / deserted animals. I feel concerned and responsible for them as well.</p>
        <p>I have always made education a priority. I organize 'Zoo Education programmes' throughout the year regularly
            involving students / NGO's / Resource Persons / Volunteers and thus the I am reaching more than 15 – 20
            thousand people through such educational programmes every year. I have given 5 acres of Zoo land for
            establishing Natural History Museum to enhance the educational potential of the Zoo. In-reach / Outreach /
            special programme for physically challenged and special group children, Literary Competitions, celebration
            of wildlife week, World Environment Day, Youth Club activities, Summer Camp activities, better signage’s,
            programme for forestry students, veterinary students, RFO trainees, keepers training, teachers training and
            publications, internship for students, officer trainees, etc., are the main education programmes organized
            here.</p>
        <p>There has been a touching response for the Animal Adoption Programme every year through sponsorship from the
            Public/Celebrities / Institutions. The income tax Department has extended tax rebate u/s 80G, for the
            donations made towards animal adoptions. The animal adoption contribution has a significant sum Rs.25 – 30
            lakhs and a valuable support for managing the affairs of Zoo. I have attained self-sufficiency in managing
            the affairs since the year 2002.</p>
        <p>Over years, I have expanded my area of service, as on today I have 113 acre exclusive facility for rescue and
            rehabilitation of wild animals. This facility also has conservation breeding centre for Indian Gaur, Dholes,
            Grey Wolf and Lion Tailed Macaque. In coming years I want to start conservation breeding of Nilgiri Langur,
            Giant Squirrel and Grey Jungle Fowl.</p>
